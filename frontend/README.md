# Frontend â€“ Car Marketplace

This frontend is a React-based single-page application (SPA) for browsing and filtering car advertisements.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **React** (`create-react-app`)
- **Node.js** â€“ used during Docker build for dependency installation and building React
- **Nginx** â€“ serves the static React build in production
- **Docker** â€“ containerizes the frontend for portability and deployment

This React app is connected to a **Django REST Framework backend**, which exposes several API endpoints under `/api/cars/`.

Examples of API routes:
- `GET /api/cars/filtered-list/` â€” get cars with optional filters
- `GET /api/cars/filters-summary/` â€” fetch available filter options
