Report: 22â€“23 June

âœ… What Has Been Done (Before or On 21 June)
	1.	PostgreSQL Container Added
	â€¢	A new PostgreSQL service was added to docker-compose.yml using a custom Dockerfile from ./db/.
	â€¢	Includes SQL initialization files: init_db.sql, init_user.sql, and migration scripts under db/updates/.
	2.	Connected Django to Postgres Container
	â€¢	The DB_HOST in Djangoâ€™s .env is now targeting the containerized PostgreSQL, no longer relying on host.docker.internal.
	3.	Dump Script for Cars Model
	â€¢	A dump_Cars.sh script was added in the backend to export car model data to a JSON file (db/dump_cars.json) using manage.py dumpdata.
	4.	Improved docker-compose Health Checks
	â€¢	Added healthcheck for Django to ensure dependent services (e.g. cron/scraper) wait until itâ€™s available.
	5.	Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor Setup Initiated
	â€¢	Monitoring stack added to docker-compose.
	â€¢	Volumes and config folder structure created.

ðŸ“… Plan for 22â€“23 June
	1.	Validate PostgreSQL Container Init Scripts
	â€¢	Confirm whether SQL migrations and dumps are applied correctly when the container initializes.
	â€¢	Check the containerized DB against local DB schema and data.
	2.	Switch Django to Use Container DB
	â€¢	Ensure Django connects successfully to containerized DB.
	â€¢	Adjust .env and settings.py as needed.
	3.	Import dump_cars.json into Container DB
	â€¢	Use loaddata or a custom init step to import the JSON into PostgreSQL inside the container.
	4.	Verify Data Pipeline from Scraper â†’ Django â†’ DB
	â€¢	Ensure full flow: scraper pulls listings â†’ Django API accepts and stores in DB â†’ reflected in CSV/ML exports.
	5.	Complete Monitoring Stack
	â€¢	Finalize Prometheus config for scraping cAdvisor.
	â€¢	Build initial Grafana dashboard with metrics relevant to scraper/Django (CPU, memory, container health, request count).
